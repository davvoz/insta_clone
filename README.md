# 📸 SteemGram - Instagram-style Steem Browser

Hey Steemians! 👋 Check out this cool project I've been working on - it's like Instagram but for the Steem blockchain!

## ✨ What's Cool About It

- 🖼️ Beautiful image-focused feed just like Instagram
- ❤️ Like and comment on posts directly 
- 👥 Follow your favorite Steem creators
- 🏷️ Browse by tags like #photography, #art etc
- 🌙 Dark mode for late night scrolling
- 📱 Fully responsive design - works great on mobile!
- 🔐 Secure login with your Steem posting key
- 🔍 Search users, tags and communities
- 🔔 Get notifications when someone likes/comments on your posts

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- Pure vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks!
- Uses the Steem JavaScript API
- Markdown parsing with Marked.js
- CSS Grid & Flexbox for layouts
- Event-driven architecture with custom EventBus
- Client-side routing with hash-based navigation
- Modular code organization with ES6 modules

## 🚧 Current Limitations & TODOs

- Can't create new posts yet (coming soon!)
- No image upload - have to use external image links
- Home is limited to photography tag for now
- Missing some advanced Steem features like:
  - Delegations 
  - Power up/down
  - Wallet functions
  - Multiple account support
- Could use better error handling in places
- Needs more comprehensive testing

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to fork and submit PRs! The code is organized into modules:

- `/auth` - Login/authentication 
- `/services` - Core business logic
- `/components` - UI components
- `/utils` - Helper functions
- `/routes` - URL routing
